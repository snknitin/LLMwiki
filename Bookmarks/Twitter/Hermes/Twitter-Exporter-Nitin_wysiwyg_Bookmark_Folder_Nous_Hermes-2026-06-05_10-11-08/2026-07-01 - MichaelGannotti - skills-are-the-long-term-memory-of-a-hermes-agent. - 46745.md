## Article Content

Skills are the long-term memory of a Hermes agent. When the agent solves a hard problem once and saves the procedure as a Markdown skill document, it can reload that procedure in future sessions without re-explaining the context, the commands, or the pitfalls. That is the promise.

The reality is messier. A skill written for the 2025 version of Hermes can become misleading after a single release changes tool names, CLI flags, or default model behavior. A skill that worked on an Ubuntu 22.04 host with an NVIDIA GPU may silently fail on an AMD ROCm box. A skill that was "good enough" in one conversation becomes a liability when it is loaded automatically into every future session.

At SMF Works we have a growing library of skills for content publishing, prediction pipelines, repo remediation, and Hermes operations. This post is the engineering discipline we use to keep them from rotting. It covers skill structure, classification, validation, testing, versioning, and the common failure modes we have learned to avoid.

### 1. What a Skill Actually Is

In Hermes a skill is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter stored in the profile's skills/ directory. The skill loader reads it at session start or when the user explicitly loads it with /skill name. The body of the document becomes part of the system prompt or instruction context.

~/.hermes/profiles/liam/skills/
├── smf-works/
│   └── SKILL.md
├── devops/
│   └── cross-channel-context/
│       └── SKILL.md
│       └── scripts/bridge.py
└── hermes-agent/
    └── SKILL.md

A skill is not a plugin. It does not import code. It is a structured instruction set the agent follows. That distinction matters because it determines what a skill can and cannot do well.

****Skill can doSkill cannot do****Declare exact commands and flagsImport Python modulesDescribe decision trees and pitfallsOverride core runtime behaviorReference reusable shell scriptsHold mutable state across sessionsDefine frontmatter metadata for routingRegister new Hermes tools natively

If you need state, new tools, or custom runtime behavior, build a plugin or extend the core. If you need reusable procedure, write a skill.

### 2. The Minimum Viable Skill

Every production skill we write follows the same template. The frontmatter is not decorative. It controls which agent profiles load it, which category it belongs to, and how the runtime treats it.

    related_skills: [cross-channel-context, smf-works]

The name field becomes the skill identifier. The version field is critical for drift detection. We bump the minor version when commands change and the patch version when examples or wording change. The tags help the skill search index route the right document to the right task.

The body then contains:

1. ****Trigger conditions**** — exact keywords, user intents, or slash commands that should activate the skill.
2. ****Procedure**** — ordered steps the agent should follow.
3. ****Concrete examples**** — real commands, file paths, and expected outputs.
4. ****Failure modes**** — what to do when a step fails.
5. ****Validation check**** — a simple command or test that proves the skill still applies.

A skill that is missing any of these five sections is a draft, not a production skill.

### 3. Classify by Risk, Not by Topic

The most useful metadata in a skill is not the topic. It is the risk class of the actions it recommends. We align skill procedures with the same RiskClass model we use for tools: READ, DRAFT, SEND, and DESTRUCTIVE.

from enum import Enum, auto

class RiskClass(Enum):
    READ = auto()          # inspect, fetch, summarize
    DRAFT = auto()         # write plans, draft files, generate configs
    SEND = auto()          # publish, deploy, notify
    DESTRUCTIVE = auto()   # delete, terminate, reset

A skill that recommends READ actions can be loaded automatically. A skill that recommends SEND or DESTRUCTIVE actions must be gated by an approval step, even if the skill itself is loaded.

****Risk ClassLoad policyApproval gate****READAuto-load by profileNoneDRAFTAuto-load by profileOptional for production writesSENDManual or keyword-triggeredRequired before executionDESTRUCTIVEManual or keyword-triggeredRequired before execution, plus dry-run check

This prevents a skill about "database cleanup" from accidentally deleting tables because the agent matched a loosely related keyword. Risk classification is the first line of defense.

### 4. The Skill Decision Tree

When Hermes encounters a user request that might match a skill, the agent should run a short decision tree. We encode this explicitly in every skill so the behavior is reproducible across models.

request
  │
  ├─ exact trigger keyword? → load skill immediately
  │
  ├─ fuzzy topic match AND risk class ≤ DRAFT? → load skill as context
  │
  ├─ fuzzy topic match AND risk class ≥ SEND? → summarize intent to user,
  │   ask for confirmation before loading
  │
  └─ no match → do not load; fall back to general reasoning

The key rule is: ****never let a high-risk skill activate on a fuzzy match****. A skill about emergency disk cleanup should not run because the user said "I need to clear some space."

### 5. Concrete Commands Beat Prose

A skill that says "check the system logs" is useless. A skill that says:

journalctl -u hermes-gateway --since "1 hour ago" --no-pager | tail -50

is usable. Every skill we ship must contain commands the agent can paste directly into the terminal. The same applies to file paths, config keys, and API endpoints.

For skills that recommend Python helpers, we store the helper in a scripts/ subdirectory next to the skill and call it from the procedure:

python3 ~/.hermes/profiles/liam/skills/devops/cross-channel-context/scripts/bridge.py lookup \
  --user michael --minutes 60 --count 10

This keeps the skill document focused on when and why, while the script handles the how. The script is versioned alongside the skill.

### 6. A Real Example: Cross-Channel Context

The cross-channel-context skill is one of our most executed skills. It is also simple enough to show the structure in full.

****Frontmatter:****

---
name: cross-channel-context
version: 1.1.0
author: Liam Hermes
metadata:
  hermes:
    tags: [devops, context, messaging, hermes]
    related_skills: [smf-works]
---

****Trigger:****

- User sends a message on one platform after the agent sent a message on another.
- User asks "what did I tell you?" or references a previous channel.

****Procedure:****

1. After every outbound send_message, run [bridge.py](https://x.com//bridge.py)

 log.
2. Before responding to any inbound message, run [bridge.py](https://x.com//bridge.py)

 lookup.
3. If context is found, inject it naturally into the reply.
4. If no context is found, respond normally.

****Failure modes:****

- [bridge.py](https://x.com//bridge.py)

 missing: recreate it from the skill reference.
- User alias not canonicalized: edit USER_ALIASES in [bridge.py](https://x.com//bridge.py)

.
- Context sounds robotic: never say "[context detected]"; weave it into the response.

****Validation check:****

ls ~/.hermes/profiles/liam/skills/devops/cross-channel-context/scripts/bridge.py \
  && echo "OK" || echo "MISSING — recreate [bridge.py](https://x.com//bridge.py)

"

This skill has no external API dependency, no mutable state inside the skill document, and a clear failure mode. Those three properties are what make it durable.

### 7. Testing Skills Without pytest

Because skills are Markdown documents, you cannot import them into a Python test. But you can test the procedures they describe. We use three lightweight techniques.

7.1 Command dry-run

For any shell command in a skill, verify it still works on a representative host:

hermes doctor
hermes tools list
hermes skills list

If the skill references a CLI flag, run the command with --help first to confirm the flag still exists.

7.2 Schema validation

We validate the YAML frontmatter of every skill in CI with a small script:

import yaml, glob, re
from pathlib import Path

required = {"name", "version", "author"}

for path in Path("~/.hermes/profiles/liam/skills").expanduser().rglob("SKILL.md"):
    text = [path.read](https://x.com//path.read)

_text()
    if not text.startswith("---"):
        raise ValueError(f"{path}: missing frontmatter")
    fm_text = text.split("---", 2)[1]
    data = [yaml.safe](https://x.com//yaml.safe)

_load(fm_text)
    missing = required - set(data.keys())
    if missing:
        raise ValueError(f"{path}: missing {missing}")
    if not re.match(r"^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$", str(data.get("version", ""))):
        raise ValueError(f"{path}: invalid version {data.get('version')}")

print("skill frontmatter OK")

This catches skills that were copy-pasted without a name, skills with malformed YAML, and version strings that do not follow SemVer.

7.3 End-to-end prompt test

We keep a list of "canonical prompts" for each skill. For smf-works, a canonical prompt is: "Publish a new Liam's Landing blog post about Hermes skills." We run these prompts through a fresh Hermes session and check that the agent loads the right skill, follows the procedure, and produces the expected artifact. This is the closest thing to a skill integration test.

### 8. Versioning and Changelog

A skill without a version is a liability. We treat each skill as a small package.

****Version bumpWhen****Major x.0.0Skill purpose changes; procedure is no longer backward compatible.Minor 1.x.0Commands, flags, or recommended tools change.Patch 1.0.xWording, examples, or formatting improve; no behavioral change.

We also keep a SKILLS_CHANGELOG.md in the project vault that records when each skill was last verified against the current Hermes release. This is separate from the skill's own version because the runtime may change even when the skill text does not.

## 2026-07-01
- skill-engineering-hermes: verified against Hermes 2.0.0, Ollama 0.9.x, Ubuntu 24.04.
- cross-channel-context: [bridge.py](https://x.com//bridge.py)

 now logs profile key.

### 9. Common Failure Modes

****FailureCauseFix****Skill loads but does not fireTrigger keywords are too genericAdd exact /command or phrase triggerSkill gives outdated CLI flagsHermes or tool upgradedAdd CI check; bump minor versionSkill is too long and wastes contextIncludes generic backgroundMove background to a reference doc; keep skill proceduralSkill conflicts with another skillBoth match the same triggerDefine explicit precedence in frontmatter tagsSkill recommends destructive action on a fuzzy matchMissing risk classificationAdd RiskClass gating to skill headerSkill works on one host but not anotherHardcoded paths or credentialsUse get_hermes_home() and env varsSkill is never updated after creationNo ownerAssign author and review date in frontmatter

### 10. Summary

A production-grade Hermes skill is a small, versioned, validated procedure document. It declares exactly when it should fire, what risk class it operates in, and how to verify it still works. It favors concrete commands over abstract advice, separates scripts from instructions, and is classified by risk before it is classified by topic.

The hard part of skill engineering is not writing the Markdown. It is maintaining the discipline to bump versions, run validation checks, and retire skills that no longer match the runtime. Hermes gets better as its skill library gets tighter. A small set of well-maintained skills beats a large library of half-remembered ones.
